# A Simple HTTP Header for CodeIgniter 3

## Is [helmetjs/helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) for CodeIgniter 3/PHP.

### How to use:
<!-- - The library HTTP headers is `application/libraries/Headers.php`. This must be loaded on your controller. Alternatively, you can auto load this in your `config/autoload.php`.
- The example controller is `application/controllers/App.php`, function `test_secure_header` and `test_header`. You can try to CURL this controller and they will return different HTTP headers.
- All headers have its own explanation, please kindly check `application/libraries/Headers.php`. Unfortunately, this is not costomizeable at the moment.
```
curl -I http://localhost/codeigniter/app/test_header/
```
```
curl -I http://localhost/codeigniter/app/test_secure_header/
``` -->
